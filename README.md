## An introduction to linear programming - Part I
This article is a short (ish) practical guide to solving optimisation problems in R, using linear programming. 

Key concepts in the article: 
- Basic concepts of linear programming
- Example: implement the knapsack problem in R
- Working with the 'ompr' package
- Variable naming and model construction 
- Step-by-step apporach to building and solving a simple model

The article can be foound [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/optimize-production-with-r-part-i-25497d29e06e). 


## An introduction to linear programming - Part II
The article continues part I, and contains a more advanced example of linear programming in R. Using a real world example, you'll see how to use linear programming to optimisae cutting steel beams. Each section in the article is broken down into two parts; one where I explain the math, and one where I show you how to implement it in R. 

Key concepts in the article:
 - Mathematical formulation of problems
 - Model parameter defintion
 - Decision variable creation
 - Implementing contraints
 - Objective function setup
 - Solution extraction and interpretation
